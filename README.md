# US-LNG-Arbitrage-Export-Economics-Analysis
This project analyzes the economic drivers of U.S. LNG exports by evaluating global natural gas price differentials, delivered netbacks, and arbitrage margins relative to Henry Hub. The goal is to assess when LNG exports are economically viable and whether export volumes respond to arbitrage signals.
